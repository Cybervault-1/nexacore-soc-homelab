## About Me

Aspiring SOC analyst building hands-on experience in threat detection, log analysis, and incident investigation through practical cybersecurity homelab projects.

---

## Lab Overview

The NexaCore SOC Homelab is a fully functional security operations environment built on VirtualBox. It simulates a small enterprise network with a Domain Controller, a target Windows endpoint, and a Kali Linux attacker machine.

Splunk Enterprise serves as the central SIEM, collecting logs from all machines and providing real time visibility into attack activity. The lab follows a complete SOC workflow: build the environment, simulate attacks, detect them in Splunk, investigate the evidence, and document findings in structured incident reports.

## Detection Workflow

Every attack simulation in this lab follows the same structured SOC workflow:

```
Attack Simulation
        |
        | Kali Linux executes attack against target endpoint
        |
        v
Log Generation
        |
        | Sysmon and Windows Security logs capture activity
        |
        v
Log Forwarding
        |
        | Splunk Universal Forwarder ships logs to Splunk (port 9997)
        |
        v
Detection
        |
        | SPL queries identify suspicious patterns in Splunk
        |
        v
Investigation
        |
        | Analyst examines event fields to build attack timeline
        |
        v
Incident Report
        |
        | Findings documented with evidence, MITRE mapping and remediation
```
